There are two options for executing the simulation.

OPTION 1
In the same directory as this README.txt file is a file called index.html.  Open index.html with a web broswer, ideally the latest version of Google Chrome.  In this case, my cookie implementation will not work so data will be lost between simulations.

OPTION 2
In the latest version of Google Chrome, navigate to http://www.flooreeda.com/robotics.  I've hosted the midterm project there.  The benefit to executing the simulation there is that cookies will work.  Apparently, most broswers disable cookies when an HTML page is loaded from a local computer.  However, when the page is loaded from a server, cookies will work as expected.
